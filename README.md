I did everything myself because I did not have a group at the time this was assigned. (I am not the best socially.)
If I had time to implement some game mechanic, maybe I'd make it so if the player got close enough, a ghost would explode?

I included particle effects at the end of the level, the game ending object emits them, which I guess informs the player they made it? (Besides the bright light from the last hallway.)
